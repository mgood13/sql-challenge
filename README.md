## Employee Information Data analysis
> This project began with the creation of a PostgreSQL database created from the csv files found in the *data* folder. We analyzed a number of attributes of the database that displayed our skill with SQL data manipulation.
* List of employee information
* List of employees hired in 1986
* List of departments with their department names and the information for the managers of each department
* List of each employee with their department name
* List of all employees with the name "Hercules" whose last names begin with the letter B (There are a surprising number of them)
* List of all the people in the Sales department
* List of all the people in the Sales and Development departments
* List of the frequency of last names among our employees.
